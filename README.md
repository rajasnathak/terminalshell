# terminalshell

A shell is an interactive command-line interpreter that runs programs on behalf of the user. A shell repeatedly
prints a prompt, waits for a command line on stdin, and then carries out some action, as directed by
the contents of the command line.

This is a Unix shell program that supports job control using the concepts of process control and signaling.
